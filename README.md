# Getting Started

#### Cloning the project

```
git clone  https://github.com/Abenezer-Tilahun/ALTR-TECH-ICT-Solution.git <Your-Build-Directory>
```

## Getting packages and dependencies
To get all package modules required to build the project run:
```
npm install
```
every package module required to build the project is listed in the package.json file. this is used as a reference to get all dependencies.

## Building 

To build the project run:
```
npm run build
```
after you run this sucessfully you'd locate the build from in the ```dist``` folder located from the parent directory of the project. two files are being built which are, ```main.js and index.html```

## Running

This should open the page in your localhost on port 8080. then you'd be able to view the built page generated using webpack.
